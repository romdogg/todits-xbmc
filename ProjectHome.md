### TFC.tv add-on for XBMC ###
You can now watch your favorite TFC.tv shows on XBMC. Install this add-on and enjoy your shows on your computer, on your Android tabled, on your iPad, on your HTPC, on your media center, on your Raspberry Pi, at home, in the toilet, in your car, at the office while your boss is not around, and on the go.

### The add-on is still in its infancy but please try it out ###
This add-on is still in Alpha, almost Beta, but feels very much stable. I just need to put in a little more features and fixes and we're good to call this Beta. But please don't let it stop you from trying it out. That Alpha-Beta thing is just geek-talk nonsense. Just try it out and enjoy your shows.

### Unfortunately, no live channels ###
The add-on does not support the live channels of TFC.tv. I would really like to have this working but unfortunately, there is no way yet of making this kind of stream/media/format work with XBMC. Until then, we'll have to watch the live channels via the TFC.tv website.

### Not an official TFC.tv product ###
This add-on is not officially released or supported by TFC.tv.  Both me and the add-on are not related in any way with TFC.tv. Please don't report any problems to them if you think the problem is with the add-on. You can check to see if the problem is related to the add-on or TFC.tv by watching the show from the TFC.tv website and see if you still experience the same problem.

### [Installation](TfcTvInstall.md) ###
Installation is easy. 1) Add repo, 2) Install add-on, 3) Configure login. Instructions are [here](TfcTvInstall.md).

### I use Facebook/Twitter to login. Can I still use this Add-on? ###
You can still use this add-on even if you're using Facebook, Twitter, et al. to login to the TFC.tv website. Your TFC.tv account has an email address associated with it. Edit your TFC.tv profile to find out what your email address is or follow these [instructions](TfcTvFindEmail.md).
